ExtJS---SpringMVC-Project-Template
==================================

Template created using Spring MVC, ExtJS and DBUnit for testing. The spring security module is already implemented 
with the LOGIN and LOGOUT capabilities. All you need to do is change the package names and remove the classes that 
you are not going to use. Thus you will save a lot of time creating and setting up your project.

Whenever Im starting a new project, this is the starting point for me. The architecture built on those files is pretty
standard however its something that will work for almost any java/extjs project size.

The application whose this project was created is a Help Desk software for customer service.

What I've used

- Spring MVC / Spring Security
- Hibernate
- DBUnit
- ExtJS
- Maven



Instructions
====================================

Import the project as a maven project using your favorite IDE.

Change the database configurations accordingly to your needs (WEB-INF / configuration / database.xml)

Configure your favorite application server.

Build and deploy your application and the database tables will be automatically created by Hibernate.
